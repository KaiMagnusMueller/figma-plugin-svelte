# figma-plugin-svelte
 
Quickly create Figma plugins using Svelte 5, Rollup, and TypeScript with this starter template. 

## Setup

Clone this repository and install dependencies with ```npm install```.

Use ```npm run dev``` to build the plugin when code changes and ```npm run build``` to create a minified version to publish for example in the Figma Community. Once built, import the plugin via the plugin menu in Figma to start it. 

This template uses [FigmaKit](https://github.com/KaiMagnusMueller/figmakit-plugin-ui), a library of close to native Figma interface components. See the repository for a list of all the available components, how they work, and a demo site where you can see them in action.
